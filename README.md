# ENT Music Players ü™ê

Are you curious about how music and technology are coming together to create a new era of musical creation and exploration? At Maar World, I am glad to be exploring the boundaries of what's possible in music and sound, using a combination of cutting-edge technology and curiosity.

Part of this mission is to create a network of playful music tools that allow users to take control of their sound in new and exciting ways. On of these tools are the "ENT Music Players" and "ENT Music Cards". they are designed to be accessible to anyone, whether you're a professional musician or a complete novice.

At the heart of this approach is the idea that music can be a collaborative, immersive, listening and creative experience at the same time. That's why I am developing a range of tools that allow users to create and remix music in new and unconventional ways. Using different algorithmic approaches, intelligent music players that will be able to understand and respond to the user's creative input, even if they've never had any musical training.

Reactivate auditory consciousness, allowing people to explore new dimensions of music and sound that they may not have even known existed. With the help of meta-musical instruments, users can play music, soundscapes, and spoken voice that are truly unique, combining analog and digital technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.

My website, www.maar.world, offers demos and the option to subscribe to a newsletter. The project encourages collaboration and experimentation and can be used in various settings, such as live performances, studio recordings, and interactive installations.

Important, in some mobile devices you need to **turn Off Silent Mode**.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy using ENT Music Players!

### Run the World (code) üï≥

Please note that this is just a basic example of how to run a p5.js project, and there are other ways to set it up depending on the specific requirements of your project for example p5.vscode extension that helps you create p5.js projects in Visual Studio Code. If you have any issues or questions, you can refer to the p5.js documentation or seek help from the p5.js community.

First, make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Next, you will need to install a local web server to run your p5.js project. You can use a package called "http-server" by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Once http-server is installed, you can start the server by running the following command:
```
http-server
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8080". This should load your p5.js project.

If you want to run the project in a different port, you can specify it with the -p option. For example, if you want to run it in port 3000, the command will be:
```
http-server -p 3000

```
Finally, you can edit the code and see the changes in the browser.

### Licence üé∂
This project utilizes p5.js and is released under the MIT license.
