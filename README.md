# Interplanetary Music Web Audio Player

> "We are nothing than melodies, we are nothing than cosmic music, played out in vibrating strings and membranes" Michio Kaku

Interplanetary Music Web Audio Player is a project that aims to develop a music player and musical instrument at the intersection of digital and physical worlds, inspired by scientific discoveries, music, and sound creation. It is a proof of concept for a creator-owned creative economy, where infinite possible sounds arise, and humans assisted by machines can listen, remix and create music. This project aims to develop a collaborative aural dimension compatible with the current state of musical creation and other communities and virtual worlds. Old and new instruments are combined to connect cultures around the world. This is the first of many entangled worlds. The web application is compatible with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, has an experimental user interface (WIP) and allows you to play music from different planets, supporting different audio formats, including MP3, WAV, and FLAC. You can check out the demo on the website: www.maar.world.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and I hope you enjoy using our Interplanetary Music Web Audio Player!

### RUN THE CODE

First, make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Next, you will need to install a local web server to run your p5.js project. You can use a package called "http-server" by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Once http-server is installed, you can start the server by running the following command:
```
http-server
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8080". This should load your p5.js project.

If you want to run the project in a different port, you can specify it with the -p option. For example, if you want to run it in port 3000, the command will be:

```
http-server -p 3000

```

Finally, you can edit the code and see the changes in the browser.
Please note that this is just a basic example of how to run a p5.js project, and there may be other ways to set it up depending on the specific requirements of your project. If you have any issues or questions, you can refer to the p5.js documentation or seek help from the p5.js community.
