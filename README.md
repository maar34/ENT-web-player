### Interplanetary Music Audio Player

> "We are nothing than melodies, we are nothing than cosmic music, played out in vibrating strings and membranes" Michio Kaku

Welcome to the Interplanetary Music Audio Player. This project is the beginning of a music player and musical instrument to be developed in the intersection of digital and physical worlds, inspired in an imaginary born in the conjunction of scientific discoveries, music, and sound creation.

Maar world is a proof of concept in a creator-owned creative economy, where infinite possible sounds arise. Every human assisted by machines can listen, remix and create music, this adventure can take us to the development of a collaborative aural dimension compatible with the current state of musical creation and other communities and virtual worlds. Old and new instruments combined in order to connect cultures around the world. This is the first of many entangled worlds.

This web application is compatible with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, and has an experimental user interface (WIP). With our player, you will be able to play music from different planets. It support different audio formats, including MP3, WAV, and FLAC.

I also encourage you to check out demo in my website: www.maar.world.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and I hope you enjoy using our Interplanetary Music Audio Player!
