# Entangled Worlds ü™ê

Welcome to Entangled Worlds, an initiative that explores the intersection of digital and physical worlds through the development of intelligent music players and meta-musical instruments.

A worldbuilding project inspired by real history, science fiction, visual arts, and music making, and serves as a proof of concept for the development of new tools in a creator-owned economy. This may be the first of many entangled worlds. The goal of the project is to develop a collaborative aural dimension compatible with the current state of musical creation and virtual worlds. Entangled Worlds is designed to connect cultures around the world by combining old and new sonic creations.

My website, www.maar.world, offers demos and the option to subscribe to a newsletter. The project encourages collaboration and experimentation and can be used in various settings, such as live performances, studio recordings, and interactive installations.

Important, in some mobile devices you need to **turn Off Silent Mode**.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy using Entangled Worlds!

### Run the World (code) üï≥

Please note that this is just a basic example of how to run a p5.js project, and there are other ways to set it up depending on the specific requirements of your project for example p5.vscode extension that helps you create p5.js projects in Visual Studio Code. If you have any issues or questions, you can refer to the p5.js documentation or seek help from the p5.js community.

First, make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Next, you will need to install a local web server to run your p5.js project. You can use a package called "http-server" by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Once http-server is installed, you can start the server by running the following command:
```
http-server
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8080". This should load your p5.js project.

If you want to run the project in a different port, you can specify it with the -p option. For example, if you want to run it in port 3000, the command will be:
```
http-server -p 3000

```
Finally, you can edit the code and see the changes in the browser.

### Licence üé∂
This project utilizes p5.js and is released under the MIT license.
